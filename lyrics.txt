Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the tide
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day


Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you


So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling
Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
That come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me


I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Woah, ah

I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire


And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)


And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case, I'm mistaken, I
Just wanna hear you say, "You got me, baby
Are you mine?"


She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

One for the road, ooh ooh
One for the road, ooh ooh

From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
The cracks in blackout blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling
But you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside

One for the road
So we all go back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?

I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this comin' from the start
The shake, rattle and roll

One for the road
So we all go back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby
I feel like I've been here before
I've been wonderin' whether later
When you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?

One for the road
So we all go back to yours
And you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me 'round, baby

Arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger
And I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality
She takes a dip in my daydreams


My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella, oh
As Arabella

Just might've tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure


Arabella's got a '70s head
But she's a modern lover, it's an exploration
She's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the colour of a constellation
Fallin' into place


My days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
That little lady sittin' on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella, oh
As Arabella


Just might've tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure


(That's magic) In a cheetah print coat
(Just a slip) Underneath it, I hope
(Asking if) I can have one of those
(Organic) Cigarettes that she smokes
(Wraps her lips) 'Round a Mexican Coke
(Makes you wish) That you were the bottle
(Takes a sip) Of your soul, and it sounds like

Blind faith, heartache
Mind games, mistakes
My sweet fireball
My sweet rigmarole


I want it all
I want it all


Old dogs, new tricks
Can you feel it?
Space age country girl
Stone cold miracle

I want it all
I want it all


And then suddenly it hit me, it's a year ago
Since I drank miniature whiskey and we shared your Coke
Said, ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road?
Leave me listening to the Stones' "2000 Light Years from Home"
